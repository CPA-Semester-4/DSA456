# üìä Tables (Abstract Data Type - ADT)

A **Table** is an abstract data type used to store **key-value pairs** (also called **records**).

* Each **key is unique**
* The **order** of records **does not matter**

---

## üîß Common Operations & Their Complexities

| Operation          | Description                             | Time (Sorted Array) | Time (Unsorted Array) |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| `Insert(key, val)` | Add a new key-value pair                | `O(n)`              | `O(1)`                |
| `Modify(key, val)` | Update value of an existing key         | `O(log n)`          | `O(n)`                |
| `Remove(key)`      | Delete record by key                    | `O(n)`              | `O(n)`                |
| `Search(key)`      | Find value by key (most used operation) | `O(log n)`          | `O(n)`                |

> üîç **Search** is usually the most frequent operation in table-based structures.

---

## üß± Implementations

### ‚úÖ Using **Sorted Array**

* Data is kept sorted by key.
* Enables **Binary Search** (`O(log n)`) due to sorting and random access.
* Can be implemented using:

  * An array of records (each having a key and value)
  * Two parallel arrays (e.g., one for keys, one for values)

### ‚ùå Using **Unsorted Array**

* No guarantee of order
* Simpler insertions (`O(1)`) ‚Äî append at end
* Search, modify, and remove take longer due to linear scanning

---

## üí° Key Insight

The **choice of underlying data structure** depends on:

* Which operations are most important
* How frequently each operation is performed

If **searching** is the top priority ‚Üí use **sorted arrays**.
If **fast insertion** is more important ‚Üí use **unsorted arrays**.

# üóÇÔ∏è Hash Tables ‚Äì Table (ADT) Implementation

A **Hash Table** is a fast and efficient way to implement the **Table Abstract Data Type (ADT)**, where each record is a unique **key-value pair**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Hash Tables Speed Up Table Operations

### üìå Hash Function

* Converts a **key** into a numerical **hash value**.
* Must return the **same value** for the same key (consistency).
* Runtime is constant: **O(1)** (independent of the number of records).

```js
hashValue = hashFunction(key)
hashIndex = hashValue % capacity
```

> Result: a valid array index from `0` to `capacity - 1`

### üì¶ Example: Inserting a Key-Value Pair

```js
insert(key, value) {
    hashValue = hashFunction(key);
    hashIndex = hashValue % capacity;
    array[hashIndex] = record(key, value);
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Collisions in Hash Tables

* **Collision**: When two different keys produce the same `hashIndex`.
* This happens because:

  ```
  Total number of possible keys > Total hash values > Total hash indices
  ```
* ‚û°Ô∏è **Collisions are unavoidable** and must be handled.

---

## üîÑ Collision Resolution Strategies

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Closed Addressing (a.k.a. Chaining)

* The `hashIndex` **always** maps to the correct index.
* **Multiple records** can be stored at the **same index** (usually as a linked list or dynamic array).
* When accessing:

  * Hash to the index
  * **Search through all records** at that index

> Example: `array[hashIndex] = [record1, record2, ...]`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open Addressing

* The `hashIndex` gives the **ideal spot**, but if it's taken, it searches for the **next available spot** (using probing techniques).
* Common probing methods:

  * **Linear Probing**: check next index `i+1, i+2,...`
  * **Quadratic Probing**: jump by squares `i+1¬≤, i+2¬≤,...`
  * **Double Hashing**: use a second hash function to determine jump size

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature            | Hash Tables                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Access/Search      | `O(1)` average (with good hash + low collisions) |
| Insert             | `O(1)` average                                   |
| Remove             | `O(1)` average                                   |
| Handles Collisions | Yes ‚Äì via **Open** or **Closed Addressing**      |
| Key Uniqueness     | Required                                         |
| Order of Records   | Not maintained                                   |

Certainly! Here's the **pseudocode** version, written in a clean and structured format:

---

# üìå Linear Probing ‚Äî Pseudocode Only

---

## üîç Search(key)

* Compute hash value of key
* Compute index = hash value mod capacity
* Loop starting at index:

  * If slot is empty ‚Üí key not found ‚Üí return failure
  * If slot matches key ‚Üí return value
  * Else ‚Üí move to next index (circular)

---

## ‚ûï Insert(key, value)

* Compute hash value of key
* Compute index = hash value mod capacity
* Loop starting at index:

  * If slot is empty or marked as tombstone ‚Üí insert (key, value) here ‚Üí stop
  * Else ‚Üí move to next index (circular)

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Modify(key, newValue)

* Compute hash value of key
* Compute index = hash value mod capacity
* Loop starting at index:

  * If slot is empty ‚Üí key not found ‚Üí stop
  * If slot matches key ‚Üí update value ‚Üí stop
  * Else ‚Üí move to next index (circular)

---

## ‚ùå Remove(key)

* Compute hash value of key
* Compute index = hash value mod capacity
* Loop starting at index:

  * If slot is empty ‚Üí key not found ‚Üí stop
  * If slot matches key:

    * Mark slot as empty
    * Set emptyIndex = current index
    * Set current = next index (circular)
    * While current slot is not empty:

      * Get key at current
      * Compute original index for current key
      * If original index is between emptyIndex and current (circularly):

        * Move current record to emptyIndex
        * Mark current as empty
        * Update emptyIndex = current
      * Move to next index (circular)
    * Stop

---

## üîÅ Cluster of Records

* A cluster is a sequence of consecutive filled slots due to collisions.
* Larger clusters increase the number of probes required for operations.

## ‚ö∞Ô∏è Tombstoning 


Here's a clean and formalized **pseudocode version** of **Linear Probing with Tombstoning**, covering **Insertion, Search, and Removal**, along with key rules:

---

## ‚ö∞Ô∏è Linear Probing with Tombstoning ‚Äî Pseudocode

### üü© Status States for Each Slot

Each array slot stores:

* A key-value pair
* A **status**:

  * `EMPTY`: Slot has never been used
  * `OCCUPIED`: Slot currently holds a valid record
  * `DELETED`: Slot once held a record but has been deleted

---

### ‚ûï Insertion(key, value)

```
Compute hashValue = hash(key)
Set index = hashValue mod capacity

Loop starting at index (circularly):
    If slot status is OCCUPIED and slot.key == key:
        Update slot.value with new value
        Stop

    If slot status is EMPTY or DELETED:
        Insert (key, value) at this slot
        Set status = OCCUPIED
        Stop
```

---

### üîç Search(key)

```
Compute hashValue = hash(key)
Set index = hashValue mod capacity

Loop starting at index (circularly):
    If slot status is EMPTY:
        // Key does not exist in table
        Return NOT FOUND

    If slot status is OCCUPIED and slot.key == key:
        Return slot.value

    // If DELETED or non-matching OCCUPIED
    Move to next index (circularly)
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Only `EMPTY` stops the search. `DELETED` does **not**.

---

### ‚ùå Remove(key)

```
Compute hashValue = hash(key)
Set index = hashValue mod capacity

Loop starting at index (circularly):
    If slot status is EMPTY:
        // Key not found
        Stop

    If slot status is OCCUPIED and slot.key == key:
        Set status = DELETED
        Stop

    // If DELETED or non-matching OCCUPIED
    Move to next index (circularly)
```

---

### üìå Summary Rules

* **Insert** at first slot marked `EMPTY` or `DELETED`
* **Search** stops only at `EMPTY`
* **Remove** marks the slot as `DELETED`, not `EMPTY`
